# Movie Recommendation System

The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based project that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their favorite films. Leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes textual data associated with movies such as genres, keywords, cast, and director to compute similarities between movies and offer tailored suggestions.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Users can input their favorite movie, and the system suggests similar movies based on textual features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Null values are handled, and relevant features are selected for recommendation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Textual features from genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and director are combined into feature vectors using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity is computed between feature vectors to determine the similarity between movies.
- **Enhanced Movie-Watching Experience**: The system aims to enrich users' movie-watching experience by offering personalized recommendations aligned with their preferences.
